        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="description">
        <p>This pasta uses sweet and tangy cherry tomatoes as a pasta sauce, 
            full of garlic and rich olive oil. Different cherry tomatoe varietys 
            can provide different taste, so I reccommend finding a smaller variety.  </p>
        <p>This recipe was introduced to me by my brother, and since then I have not gone 
            back to marinara. It requires few ingredients and can be stored for future use. 
            Great for tomatoe lovers like my dad!</p>
