        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="description">
        <p>This easy two ingredient mango mousse is tangy, creamy, and 
            sweet. It can be stored in the freezer or fridge, depending 
            on how you like the consistency.</p>
        <p>This recipe was made by me, and is inspired by Mango Lassi. 
            It utilizes alphonso mangos, so it is truly a taste of home. 
            Enjoy!</p>
