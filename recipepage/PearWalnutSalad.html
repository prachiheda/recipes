        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="description">
            <p>This salad is refreshing, crunchy, salty, and sweet. Fresh bosc pears 
                and candied walnuts add sweetness, feta adds saltiness, while slivers of
                 red onion add a much needed crunch and spice. </p>
            <p>This recipe was inspired by a salad I ate in Lake Tahoe, which truly 
                changed the way I view salad. This is a great party starter and will 
                surely be complimented by guests of all ages.</p>
